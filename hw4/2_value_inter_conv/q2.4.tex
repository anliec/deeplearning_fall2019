\begin{align}
    \left\| T(x_1) - T(x_2) \right\|_{\infty} &\leq \alpha \left\| x_1 - x_2 \right\|_{\infty} \label{2.4bonus_eq}
\end{align}


From equation \ref{2.4bonus_eq} we know that $T$ is continuous and monotonic.
In addition this equation give us a bound of it's derivative, by definition $\frac{dT(x)}{dx_i} \in [-\alpha,\alpha]$ For all $x_i$ dimension of $x$.

So the hyper surface designed by $T$ must intersect with the hyper plan designed by the identity function, which is continuous, monotonic and increasing with slope $1 > \alpha$.
So there must be at least one fixed point for $T$.

In addition, if there is two different fixed point, $x^{*1}$ and $x^{*2}$, then:

\begin{align*}
    \left\| T(x^{*1}) - T(x^{*2}) \right\|_\infty
    &= \left\| x^{*1} - x^{*2} \right\|_\infty \\
    &> \alpha \left\| x^{*1} - x^{*2} \right\|_\infty \text{ as } \alpha < 1 \text{ and } \left\| x^{*1} - x^{*2} \right\|_\infty \neq 0
\end{align*}

So we can't have two distinct fixed points for $T$.

In conclusion, there is one unique fixed point where $T(x) = x$.
