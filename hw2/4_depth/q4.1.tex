According to the definition we have:

\begin{align*}
    W^{(1)} &= 2 \cdot I
\end{align*}

Which let us simplify the expression of $f_1$:

\begin{align*}
    f_1(x) &= | W^{(1)} x + b | \\
    &= | 2 \cdot I \cdot x + b | \\
    &= | 2 x + b | \\
\end{align*}

In other word the transformation is the same on every dimension and is the function $| 2 x - 1 |$.
This function get to zero for $x=0.5$ and as value of $1$ in $0$ and $1$ and is linear between those points.

In conclusion there is two input region on this interval.

\begin{align*}
    R = \left\{ \left[ 0, 0.5 \right]^d , \left[ 0.5, 1 \right]^d \right\}
\end{align*}
