As said in Question \ref{q1.1}, we want to build a network such as:

\[
    h_t = XOR \left( h_{t-1}, x_t \right)
\]

\paragraph{}
In this question we have a lot of variable and a lot of different combination are so possible to get the correct results.
We are here going to make it as simple as possible, to help the correction and the redaction of this report.

\paragraph{}
First we are going to set that $C_t = h_t$, this is easy to make by using the following weights:

\begin{align*}
    W_o &=
    \begin{bmatrix}
        0 \\
        0
    \end{bmatrix}\\
    b_o &= 1
\end{align*}

\paragraph{}
Which give us $o_t = 1$, which translate in:

\begin{align*}
    h_t &= o_t \cdot tanh(C_t) \\
    &= tanh(C_t) \\
    &= C_t \text{ for } C_t \in {0,1}
\end{align*}

\paragraph{}
On the same idea we define $C^{\sim}_t = 1 - h_t$ with:

\begin{align*}
    W_C &=
    \begin{bmatrix}
        -1 \\
        0
    \end{bmatrix}\\
    b_C &= 1
\end{align*}

\paragraph{}
Now we want $f_t$ to be $1$ if $x_t$ is zero and $0$ otherwise:

\begin{align*}
    W_t &=
    \begin{bmatrix}
        0 \\
        -1
    \end{bmatrix}\\
    b_t &= 1
\end{align*}

\paragraph{}
Now we want $i_t$ to be $1$ if $x_t$ is one and $0$ otherwise:

\begin{align*}
    W_t &=
    \begin{bmatrix}
        0 \\
        1
    \end{bmatrix}\\
    b_t &= 0
\end{align*}

As previously, we assume here that $C_t$ and $h_t$ are initialised to zero.
