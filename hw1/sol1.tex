\section{Gradient Descent - 1}

\begin{align*}
\frac{\partial \left( f \left( w^{(t)} \right) + \left\langle w - w^{(t)} , \nabla f \left( w^{(t)} \right) \right\rangle + \frac{\lambda}{2} \| w - w^{(t)} \| ^2 \right) }{\partial w} &= 0 \\
\frac{\partial \left\langle w , \nabla f \left( w^{(t)} \right) \right\rangle  }{\partial w} + \lambda \| w - w^{(t)} \| &= 0 \\
\| w - w^{(t)} \| &= - \frac{1}{\lambda} \frac{\partial \left\langle w , \nabla f \left( w^{(t)} \right) \right\rangle  }{\partial w} \\
\end{align*}

So the solution is on a sphere of center $w^{(t)}$ and radius $\frac{1}{\lambda} \frac{\partial \left\langle w , \nabla f \left( w^{(t)} \right) \right\rangle  }{\partial w}$. We are looking
