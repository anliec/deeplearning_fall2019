\paragraph{}

If a graph has a topological ordering, then there is no edges going backward following this ordering.
Which mean that there is no cycle on the graph, as you can't go back to the place where you started to try creating your
graph, no matter where you try.
For the same reason there is either no edge in the graph or all the edges are directed.

So, if we have a graph with a valid topological ordering, we have a graph with directed edges and no cycle, a DAG.
