\paragraph{}
If $G$ is a DAG, then according to the lemma, at least one node has on input edges.
If we took such a node out of the graph as well as all the edges going from this node, the remaning graph would be a DAG
too (we only removed edges, we can't create cycle be removing edges).
We can now repeat the previous step on the newly created graph, until we got an empty graph.

The order in which we took the node out is a possible topological ordering.
